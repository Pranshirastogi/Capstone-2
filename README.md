# Capstone-2
# EV Charging Patterns Analysis and Prediction
Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing electric vehicle (EV) charging patterns, predicting energy consumption, estimating costs, and providing real-time insights through an interactive Streamlit application. It aims to optimize grid management, enhance user experience, and support strategic decision-making for EV infrastructure planning.

Objectives
EV Charging Pattern Analysis:

Identified peak charging hours, station utilization rates, and seasonal charging trends.

Energy Consumption Prediction:

Modeled power usage trends to optimize electricity grid demand and prevent potential overloads.

Cost Prediction:

Developed machine learning models to estimate charging costs based on vehicle type, user profile, charging duration, and other key parameters.

Forecasting Cost:

Predicted the expected charging cost at both the start and end of a charging session to enhance cost transparency for users.

Streamlit App Deployment:

Built an interactive Streamlit application to deploy trained ML models, allowing real-time predictions, dynamic data visualization, and user-driven exploration of insights.

Results
Successfully identified critical charging patterns, including peak hours and underutilized stations, providing actionable insights for load balancing and operational efficiency.

Achieved accurate energy consumption forecasts, aiding in proactive grid management and strategic energy planning.

Developed cost estimation models that demonstrated high predictive accuracy across different vehicle types and usage scenarios.

Enabled users to predict and compare charging costs before and after charging sessions, improving cost predictability and user satisfaction.

Delivered an intuitive and responsive web-based tool via Streamlit, making data-driven decision-making accessible to stakeholders.
